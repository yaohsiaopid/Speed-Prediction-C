# Speed-Prediction-Model

(This branch is for motion\_estimation(former optflw) integration. The main difference from branch master is that this is for optflw use, so there is no noise.)

A Speed-prediction model to simulate bumps of fruitfly neurons.

First generate data with [NetworkGenerator.py](Speed-Prediction-Model/NetworkGenerator.py)

then do the decisionmaking with MATLAB.
